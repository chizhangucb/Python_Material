Important ideas in big data processing.
- Implicit representation of streams of sequential data taht does not explicitly store each element.
- Declarative programming languages to manipulate and transfrom data
- Distributed and parallel computing.


An iterator is an object that can provide the next element of a sequence.
The __next__ method of an iterator returns the next element.
The build-in next function invokes the __next__ methond on its argument.

map(func, iterable): iterate over fun(x) for x in iterable
filter(func, iterbale): iterate over x in iterable if func(x)
zip(first_iter, second_iter): iterate over co-indexed (x, y) pairs
reversed(seequence): iterate over x in a sequence in reverse order
list(iterable)
tuple(iterable)
sorted(iterable)

A generator is an iterator, created by a generator function
A generator function is a function that yields values instead of returning them.
A normal function returns once; a generator function yields multiple times.

A name bound in a local frame is not accessible to other environments, except those that extend the frame.
