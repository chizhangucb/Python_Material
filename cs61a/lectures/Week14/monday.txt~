A distributed computing application consists of multiple programs running on multiple computers that together coordinate to perform some task. 

The internet Protocal(IP) specifies how to transfer packets of data among networks. 
- Networks are inherently unreliable at any point.
- The structure of a network is dynamic, not fixed
- No system exists to monitor or track communication.

The design of the Internet Protocal (IPv4) imposes constraints:
- Packets are limited to 65,535 bytes each.
- Packets may arrive in a different order than they were sent.
- Packets may be duplicated or lost.

The Transmission Control Protocal (TCP) improve reliability.
(The socket module in Python implements the TCP.)

All TCP connections begin with a sequence of messages called a "handshake" which verifies that communication is possible.

Handshake Goals:
- computer A knows that it can send data to and receive data from computer B.
- computer B knows that it can send data to and receive data from computer A. 
- Lots of seperate connections can exist without any confusion.
- The number of required messages is minimized.
